# time_series_app
This file contains the shiny codes for building an app for time series analysis.
It makes use of the "forecast" package developed by Robert Hyndman to build exponential smoothing, ARIMA, and ARIMAX models for forecasting.
It was developed as part of a project for a hospital to help in the planning of hospital beds in response to COVID.
The app is supposed to simplify the process for doctors who may not be familiar with time-series analysis.
This first version of the app has not had any cosmetic improvement done to it.
Hence, using it will require some experience in time-series analysis.
Later versions will include more descriptions and explanations together with an improved layout.
